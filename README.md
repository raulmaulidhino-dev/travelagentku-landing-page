# Reflection
This was a 1-week mini project built during my RevoU Fundamental Course (@revou-fundamental-course) 10-day mini course: Software Engineering. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point
and improving my skills in Front-End Development.

One of the main challenges during the project development is Auto-Sliding Animation. This made me spend a few days to understand and implement the logic of Auto-Sliding Animation. 
Due to project time constraints, I had to be focused more on implementing the layout and form logic to enhance the user interface (UI).

At the end of the day, the technologies I implemented in this project are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I choose the basic website development tools to follow the rules of the mini course assignment. In the future projects, I plan on exploring CSS and JavaScript frameworks and libraries to help me developing web projects efficiently.
